# Childcare Costs & Socioeconomic Patterns

## Overview
This project explores how childcare prices vary by geography and how those differences relate to unemployment and other socioeconomic indicators. The results are presented via dashboards and static visualizations.

## Data
- National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) or similar public data
- Variables: county/state, childcare price, age group, provider type, unemployment rates

## Tools
- Power BI and/or R (ggplot2, dplyr)

## Key Questions
- How do childcare costs vary by state and county?
- How is affordability related to unemployment or income?
- Which regions face the greatest childcare affordability challenges?

## Outputs
- Power BI dashboard
- Static visuals (maps, bar charts, line charts) in `docs/` or `results/`

## Repository Structure
- `code/` – R scripts or BI data prep files
- `data/` – link or description of source datasets
- `docs/` – dashboard screenshots and PDF report
- `results/` – exported charts

## How to Use
1. Open the Power BI file (if provided) or R scripts for visuals.
2. Use the screenshots in `docs/` for quick review of key insights.
